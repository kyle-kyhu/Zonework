Zonework is a django capstone project for Coding Nomads.  The concept can be though of as pacing tool for learning.  I used a similar logic to help with keep up with the commitment of reading, watching, coding, failing and repeating the hard and lonely process.  

This tool should help users:
1. Put in the work 
2. Feel comfortable with failure
3. Work details can be communicated to mentors, community, etc
4. Create a cadence of work via dashboard 
5. Create scheduled recap for status updates

This project will used as a group project.  

To get started:
- python manage.py runserver
- copy and paste this url for the homepage.  http://127.0.0.1:8000/index/
